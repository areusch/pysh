* PySH - Python for shell scripting
** Idea: Write shell scripts with Python, but retain the nice bash-like subprocess functionality
** Parts
*** Shell script header which auto-installs PySH
*** Convenient access to a bash-like interface
*** Python 2/3 agnostic
*** A way to import Python libraries easily. Two cases:
**** Scripts in the project
***** Create a synthetic module? Inject into sys.path?
***** Issue is if any other sys.path entries come in front of that path.
**** PyPI libraries
***** Pipenv virtualenv
*** Unit tests?
** Non-goals
*** Fancy command-line parser
*** General script utilities
